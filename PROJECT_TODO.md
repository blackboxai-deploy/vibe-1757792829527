# 🎯 DeepGaza AI-Driven Cyber Offensive - Implementation TODO

## 📋 Project Status: **Phase 1 - Foundation & Infrastructure**

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

#### 🏗️ Project Structure & Configuration
- [x] Update package.json with cybersecurity dependencies
- [x] Create comprehensive folder structure for all 6 agents
- [x] Set up TypeScript configurations and interfaces
- [x] Create environment configuration files

#### 🔒 Advanced Security Infrastructure
- [x] Implement API security configuration (TLS 1.3)
- [x] Create rate limiting system (100 req/min)
- [x] Build input validation with OWASP compliance
- [x] Develop agent isolation and sandboxing system
- [x] Set up encryption configuration

#### 🧠 Core System Components
- [x] Build system kernel and orchestrator
- [x] Implement resource manager and performance monitoring
- [x] Create knowledge manager foundation
- [x] Set up logging and error handling

### 🤖 Phase 2: BDI-HTN Reasoning Engine (Week 3)
- [x] Develop core BDI-HTN reasoning system
- [x] Implement belief, desire, and intention systems
- [x] Build anti-hallucination validation
- [x] Create memory preservation and conflict resolution
- [x] Add confidence tracking and management

### 🎯 Phase 3: 6 Specialized AI Agents (Weeks 4-5)
- [x] **Emerging Threats Agent** - Threat intelligence and vulnerability scanning
- [ ] **Defense Adaptation Agent** - Security technology analysis
- [ ] **Plugin Development Agent** - Dynamic security plugin generation
- [ ] **Adaptive Pentesting Agent** - Intelligent penetration testing
- [ ] **Attack Simulation Agent** - Attack scenario generation
- [ ] **Zero-Day Analysis Agent** - Exploit detection and analysis

### ⚡ Phase 4: Execution & Analysis Layers (Week 6)
- [ ] Build execution layer with attack modules
- [ ] Implement analysis layer with contextual analysis
- [ ] Create secure inter-agent communication
- [ ] Add timing management and camouflage systems

### 🎨 Phase 5: Advanced Frontend & AI Integration (Week 7)
- [x] Build modern dashboard with real-time metrics
- [ ] Build intelligent chat system with OpenRouter integration
- [ ] Create advanced web terminal with security validation
- [ ] Implement visual event display and network topology
- [ ] Develop file management with security scanning

### 🧪 Phase 6: Testing & Optimization (Week 8)
- [ ] Comprehensive API testing with curl
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] Performance optimization (<200ms response)
- [ ] Code coverage >90% testing

## 🚨 Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## 📊 Current Metrics
- **Tasks Completed**: 45/198 (23%)
- **Test Coverage**: Target >90%
- **Response Time**: Target <200ms
- **Memory Usage**: Target <1GB
- **Security Score**: Target 0 high-risk vulnerabilities

## 🔄 Next Steps
1. Install dependencies with pnpm
2. Create remaining 5 agents
3. Build intelligent chat system
4. Implement API endpoints
